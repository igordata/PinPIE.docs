      <h1>Quick overview</h1>
    </header>
    <p>PinPIE is designed to handle about 100-150 pages per second at cheap $5 VPS/VDS hosting. It can be used at shared hosting as well.</p>
    <p>PinPIE stores content in \*.php files, located in /pages folder. This files are included before template is applied. So all page options could be set in the page code. Subdirectories are allowed. Pages can handle URLs longer, than a path to a file. See URL handling section.</p>
    <p>PinPIE uses tags. Tags have flexible caching mechanics, automatically refreshing expired tags, if its files or files of its children were changed.</p>

      <h1>Starting</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Folder /sources of this project contains required files and folders to make PinPIE work properly. Copy its contents to your project. Also you have to create index.php to include PinPIE, default template and index page. You can find [minimal site example here](/examples/en/minimal/).</p>
  </section>

    <header>
      <h1>Entry point</h1>
    </header>
    <p>PinPIE require to be included in main entry point of your project, and all requests have to be rerouted to that file. Generally, the main entry point for site code is `ROOT/index.php`. This file require to have `include 'pinpie/pinpie.php';` line to start PinPIE working.</p>
    <p>This, in fact, are the only things you have to do to start using PinPIE.</p>

    <h2>About preinclude.php and postinclude.php</h2>
    <p>For every request there are to files, that will be included if they exist. Before processing a page file `ROOT/preinclude.php` will be included. And `ROOT/postinclude.php` will be included after page is processed and assembled. If you will upgrade PinPIE with new version, this files will not be overwritten, because this
      files doesn't exist in PinPIE project. So feel free to modify them corresponding your needs.</p>
